        <h1>Graphic Tablets/Display Tablets</h1>
        <h5>Digital Art</h5>
        <hr>
        <div class="about">
            <img src="../../images/How-You-Can-Do-This/tab.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                The only things you need to get started with digital painting are a graphics tablet, and painting
                software of your choice. Tablets are a must for digital artists and designers. Many start of by just a
                graphic tablet.
                <br>
                They generally have just two components: a touch-pad, and a stylus (a digital pen),
                though fancier models will also have a number of buttons and dials along the side. Because these tablets
                don’t have screens, you will need a laptop or computer to plug them into (usually via a USB cable).
                <br>
                They are great to start your journey in the world of art, and when you,re getting more serious you can
                upgrade to a display tablet as, while using graphic tablet you have to keep your eyes on the computer
                screen, meaning you can't watch your hands as you paint - this can take some getting used to.
                <br>
                Whereas, display tablets function like graphic tablets, but with a built-in monitor. You can draw
                directly onto a screen, which feels more intuitive (especially when you’re used to painting on paper or
                canvas).
                <br>
                Now, if you wanna go into professional business its time for <i>"All-In-One" Tablets.</i> These include
                popular tablets like the iPad Pro or Microsoft Surface Pro. The big advantage is that you won’t need an
                extra laptop or computer to plug your tablet into – these are essentially a tablet and computer 2-in-1.
                This makes them very portable – you can take them with you wherever you go. The downside is that they
                are more expensive, and you have a very limited selection of software available to you. Important: If
                you choose to use an Apple iPad, you will also need a stylus with pressure sensitivity. The Apple Pencil
                has built in pressure sensitivity, but it only works with the iPad Pro – if you are using a regular iPad
                there are options like the Adonit Pixel Stylus.

        <h1>Digital Audio Workstation</h1>
        <h5>Music Production</h5>
        <hr>
        <div class="about">
            <img src="../../images/How-You-Can-Do-This/daw.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                A digital audio workstation (DAW) is a software program used for composing, producing, recording, mixing
                and
                editing audio and MIDI.
                <br>
                DAWs facilitate mixing of multiple sound sources on a time-based grid.
                There are lots of different DAWs out there, each with different strengths and weaknesses.
                There are a few important points to consider as you choose which DAW you’ll use for your music.
                The first is that despite different looks and workflows, they all essentially do the same thing—make
                music.
                <br>
                Once you grasp the basic metaphors of digital music production, your choice of DAW will seem a little
                less
                important. The main differences between them are mainly about features and workflow.
                <br>
                That means the only way to choose the best DAW for you is by testing them out and finding which one fits
                your needs best.
                <br>
                Once you chose your favorite DAW, it will be the perfect environment for every step of your music
                production
                workflow.Many producers prefer to write in their DAW by creating loops and clips of their ideas on the
                fly.
                Structuring isolated fragments into full arrangements is one of the biggest strengths of a DAW-based
                songwriting workflow.
                <br>
                And mixing has never been easier than with a DAW and plugins.
                However you use it, the DAW is where your inspiration and workflow collide, and the production process
                takes place.
                <br>
                Once you get a hang of producing music, you can take step further and start the writing lyrics and make
                full blown songs or albums. Even if you are only into producing, basics of songwriting and composition
                is important for modern producers.

        <h1>Blender</h1>
        <h5>Animation</h5>
        <hr>
        <div class="about">
            <img src="../../images/How-You-Can-Do-This/animation.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                <i>"Easy to learn, hard to Master"</i>, It's easier to get into animation today than ever before.
                Software's getting cheaper (or even free), and most modern computers can handle the more simple
                animation tasks (mostly 2D). But, you don't need to be a Disney-grade animator to create really cool
                animations.
                <br>
                You can start small and simple and slowly develop your skills and unique style. You don't even need to
                know how to draw well.
                <br>
                So, Blender would ba a great choice to explore the world of animation as its a free, open-source, 3D
                program, it provides a broad spectrum of modeling, texturing, lighting, animation and video
                post-processing functionality in one package.
                <br>
                You can, as always, upgrade to different software, once you are conformable to the basics. You can also
                go to YouTube (mentioned Above) with your animation. Though you might need a little more than just
                knowing animation. A process of making a good animation may look like this:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Work on the Story- The first (and probably the most important) part of making any film is a good
                        story.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Write a Script- Once the idea for the story is ready to put into words, the next step is writing
                        the script.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have a Concept Art- Once the script is ready, concept art is often created to establish the
                        visual style of the film.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prepare a Storyboard- Next is creating a storyboard, which is probably one of the most important
                        steps in figuring out the film.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a Animatic- An animatic is the movie version of your storyboard. If storyboard is like a
                        comic book, then an animatic is like a movie.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create Assets- At this point, depending on your animation medium of choice, we'll be creating
                        the different assets for our film.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Final Animation- We're finally ready for animation!
                    </li>
                </ol>
