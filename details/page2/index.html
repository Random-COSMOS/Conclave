                Digital Art is an artistic composition that relies heavily on the use of technology in its creation.
                It's been around since the 70's and is used mainly for advertising and visual for film. Digital Art
                comes in many forms, most often it's either solely computer generated, drawn various types of software,
                or digital paintings sourced from photos. Digital art couldn't really exist without computers. Those
                machines so us today got their start in the 1940s, when the first true computer, the Electronic
                Integrator and Computer, or the ENIAC, was created for military purposes. Artists first began exploring
                possibilities of art from computers and related technologies in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
                <br> 
                The rise of digital technology has acted as a way to generalize the buying a piece of art
                previously monopolized by auction houses’ regular customers. Online selling affordable paintings and
                drawings are popping up and reshaping the rules of offer and Thousands of unknown artists now have
                access to an online market, taking care of all the buying promoting processes.
                <br>
                Digital art also includes new art experiences when it comes to exhibitions, ballet and opera;

                virtual reality has become the main tool used to shape those experiences. We now be in the middle of a
                Vivaldi concert at the Fenice in Venice or surrounded by a Van Gogh’s while comfortably seated on a
                living room couch. We can now be alone facing the art and feel is to be in the middle of a creation.
                <br> 
                Many national museums are trying to take this technological turn by their collection and archives
                in 3D, which is a new powerful marketing tool. They will be diffuse an easy access to their collection
                to any clients that have access to an internet connection. means being able to enjoy a close view of the
                Mona Lisa without being bothered by other tourist examine in detail the David sculpture of Michelangelo.
                <br> 
                Digital art is also helping the preservation of our cultural heritage. One that is deeply moving
                and helps us understand how useful virtual reality in art can be, is the project. Led by Sketchfab, a
                website that helps you publish and share 3D and VR content this project reunited a group of
                archeologists who recreated in 3D the remains of missing including the Palmyre site devastated by ISIS
                and the Chappel of the hospital in Paris. Digital art is moving fast; new ways of promoting, selling
                creatin quickly emerging and evolving. This is an opportunity for a generation to use the knowled
                digital tools to deepen their interest in art enrich artistic emotions and experiences.
