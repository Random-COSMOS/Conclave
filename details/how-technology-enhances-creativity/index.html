        <h1>How Technology <br> Enhances Creativity</h1>
        <p>Technology has come a long way. From flip phones to smart phones, technology these days never fails to
            impress the world. As technology advances with time, it also enhances people’s creativity.

            <h2>How it Helps</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
            People are able to constantly search things and discover new information they didn’t know before. It allows
            us to become educated and have an outlet to speak our minds.
            <br>
            This ties in with people’s creativity and how it’s shown. Now not only can we share the ideas we have but
            also view each others. What I mean by this is watch people’s videos posted on the internet through Youtube.
            <br>
            Youtube has become a multibillion dollar enterprise over the past years. Although relatively new, Youtube’s
            success is owed to all the video creators and their viewers. They are able to voice their different skills
            and opinions. A lot of Youtubers discuss that without Youtube they would have been in worse shape with no
            way to channel their messages to the world. Using video cameras and editing their videos on computers, it
            all aids them to put out their best product. Technology is able to help boost their creativity.
            <br>
            Becoming a more technological society increases our potential to engage in the types of experiences that
            lead to greater creativity. Having this technology available, people can make whatever they want. We have
            the reassurance of knowing that we can upload something straight from our phones and connect with
            information and people around the world.

            <h2>Defining The Creative Process</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
            While many like to think of creativity as a mysterious process, researchers generally agree that there are
            clear principles at work, such as a lucid formulation of the problem, knowledge and practice in a particular
            field, crossing domains and persistence.
        </p>

        <h3>Principles in formulating a creative process-</h3>
        <div class="processes">
            <div class="pointers">
                <h4>Forming intent</h4>
                <p>Every creative act starts with a purpose. Whether it is a marketer trying to solve for a particular
                    business objective, a designer working with a specific brief or an artist looking to express a
                    distinct
                    idea or emotion. It is through forming intent that we establish the constraints under which
                    creativity
                    thrives.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="pointers">
                <h4>Searching The Domain</h4>
                <p>
                    All great artists—or for that matter, anybody who is good at anything—are students of their craft.
                    By thoroughly examining their domain, they become aware of a variety of techniques, alternative
                    approaches and different philosophies. The larger the creative toolbox, the greater the possibility
                    for creative excellence.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="pointers">
                <h4>Tangling Hierarchies</h4>
                <p>
                    Truly revolutionary creative acts come from synthesizing across domains, as Picasso did with African
                    and European art or Darwin did by combining insights from economics, geology and biology to come up
                    with his theory of natural selection.

                    <b>Innovation:</b> Innovation happens by continuously improving a process or product and technology
                    has contributed in improving many of these. So yes, of course, technology is changing the face of
                    innovation. However, as a business, it is important not to place technology at the forefront of
                    innovation, since relying on technology solutions can, at times, hinder innovation.

                    technology, such as 3D printing, digital content creation and other forms of digital interaction,
                    which give us the chance to explore new things and to express ourselves in various ways.

                    creativity in many ways. There is a desire to invent and to create and with technology we can enter
                    new avenues easily and connect with information and people around the world.

            <h2>Technology Eradicates Barriers To Creative Excellence</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
            Luck and chance have always played a role in creativity. What if Picasso had not wandered into that African
            art exhibition or Darwin not taken the voyage on <i>The Beagle</i>? These happy accidents are interesting
            and
            exciting, but luck is not a strategy. In fact, history is full of examples of missed opportunities because
            of deficiencies of information.
            <br>
            Darwin’s theory remained incomplete for half a century, because he was not able to specify a mechanism by
            which traits were inherited. Ironically, his contemporary, Gregor Mendel, had discovered the principles of
            genetics shortly after Darwin published his famous work, but they remained completely unaware of each other
            for their entire lifetimes.
            <br>
            Clearly, technology has transformed human experience. We are no longer separated by time and space, but are
            largely working off of the same massive database. The sum total of human knowledge is merely a few clicks
            away. Domains are no longer hidden behind barriers of circumstance or tradition, but are accessible to
            anyone with a search engine.

            The key finding of a new study by Pfeiffer Consulting, commissioned by Adobe (CMO.com is owned by Adobe).
            The study is based on qualitative research in which Pfeiffer interviewed 75+ creative professionals in the
            United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Respondents were hand-picked and ranged from having two to
            35 years of work experience.
            <br>
            According to the research, more than half of respondents expressed interest in artificial intelligence (AI)
            and machine learning and what they add to the creative process. Just 12% of respondents said they were
            totally uninterested.
            <br>
            The general attitude, according to the study, is that creatives are not worried about these technologies
            taking over their jobs because <i>creativity</i>, they believe, is <i>profoundly human</i>.

                <p>One way many professors and teaching assistants are using technology to help students get creative is
                    through the use of devices and media that students already have! Almost all, if not all of today’s
                    students have access to a photo and or video recording device. Professors can use digital media in
                    projects for their students, regardless of the subject. By asking students to step outside their
                    comfort zone and produce their own piece of media, we are asking students to be creative, to think
                    in a variety of ways, and to apply their learning through the use of technology. Nicole Flynn writes
                    on Cielo24 that the concept BYOD (or bring your own device) to class will increase the concept that
                    students can use technology to enhance their own learning. The BYOD idea will likely take hold
                    immediately within the next one to two years, states Nicole Flynn.</p>

                <p> In STEM subjects, the use of technology and the need for creativity go hand-in-hand. Technology
                    provides the opportunities for learners of STEM students to be more creative than ever before.
                    Students have the opportunity to build virtual models of their devices, programs, robots, and other
                    gadgets. According to Meghan Cortez, of EdTech Magazine, technology has enabled engineering students
                    more opportunities than ever before to create and innovate. In the future, we can look for advances
                    in robotic technology through “Generation Z,” the name of our current generation growing up with
                    technology. The article “Technology Can Help Expand Creativity,” discusses how Generation Z students
                    believe that learning to use technology in a creative way is essential to being career-ready.</p>
