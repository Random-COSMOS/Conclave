        <div class="about">
            <p class="first">
                Digital Art is an artistic composition that relies heavily on the use of technology in its creation.
                It's been around since the 70's and is used mainly for advertising and visual for film. Digital Art
                comes in many forms, most often it's either solely computer generated, drawn various types of software,
                or digital paintings sourced from photos. Digital art couldn't really exist without computers. Those
                machines so us today got their start in the 1940s, when the first true computer, the Electronic
                Integrator and Computer, or the ENIAC, was created for military purposes. Artists first began exploring
                possibilities of art from computers and related technologies in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
                <br>
                The rise of digital technology has acted as a way to generalize the buying a piece of art
                previously monopolized by auction houses’ regular customers. Online selling affordable paintings and
                drawings are popping up and reshaping the rules of offer
            </p>

                and Thousands of unknown artists now have
                access to an online market, taking care of all the buying promoting processes.
                <br>
                Digital art also includes new art experiences when it comes to exhibitions, ballet and opera; virtual
                reality has become the main
                tool used to shape those experiences. We now be in the middle of a
                Vivaldi concert at the Fenice in Venice or surrounded by a Van Gogh’s while comfortably seated on a
                living room couch. We can now be alone facing the art and feel is to be in the middle of a creation.
                <br>
                Many national museums are trying to take this technological turn by their collection and archives
                in 3D, which is a new powerful marketing tool. They will be diffuse an easy access to their collection
                to any clients that have access to an internet connection. means being able to enjoy a close view of the
                Mona Lisa without being bothered by other tourist examine in detail the David sculpture of Michelangelo.
                <br>
                Digital art is also helping the preservation of our cultural heritage. One that is deeply moving
                and helps us understand how useful virtual reality in art can be, is the project. Led by Sketchfab, a
                website that helps you publish and share 3D and VR content this project reunited a group of
                archeologists who recreated in 3D the remains of missing including the Palmyre site devastated by ISIS
                and the Chappel of the hospital in Paris. Digital art is moving fast; new ways of promoting, selling
                creatin quickly emerging and evolving. This is an opportunity for a generation to use the knowled
                digital tools to deepen their interest in art enrich artistic emotions and experiences.

        <h1>3D Modeling</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="about">
            <p class="first">
                It is true to say that 3D technology is the best tool for creative lovers. This is because it enables
                manufacturer to open up new possibilities to grab the attention of more customers,
                Many experts have predicted that the introduction of 3D technology will enable the creativity lovers to
                fulfill their every desire in an innovative manner.
                Whether you want to design a phone or furniture mode, 3D technology will soon make it possible for you
                to accomplish your goals perfectly.
                3D modeling is a technique in computer graphics for producing a 3D digital representation of any object
                or surface.
                An artist uses special software to manipulate points in virtual space(called vertices) to form a mesh: a
                collection of vertices that form an object.
                These 3D objects can be generated automatically or created manually by deforming the mesh, or otherwise
                manipulating vertices.
                3D models are used for a variety of mediums including video games, movies, architecture, illustration,
                engineering, and commercial advertising.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/page2/3d-modeling.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="last">
                The 3D modeling process produces a digital object capable of being fully animated, making it an
                essential process for character animation and special effects.
                <br>
                The core of a model is the mesh which is best described as a collection of points in space.
                These points are mapped into a 3D grid and joined together as polygonal shapes, usually triangles or
                quads. Each point or vertex has its own position on the grid and by combining these points into shapes,
                the surface of an object is created.
                Models are often exported to other software for use in games or movies. But some 3D modeling programs
                allow the creation of a 2D images using a process called 3D rendering. This technique is fantastic for
                creating hyper-realistic scenes using sophisticated lighting algorithms.
                <br>
                Therefore, it could be said now that 3D printing will offer uncountable benefits to small scales as well
                as the large-scale manufacturing industry to drive more revenue. If you also belong to the manufacturing
                industry then you should also tap into the potential of this superb technology.

        <div class="about">
            <p class="first">
                The most important part of capturing product photos is the work that happens AFTER they’re shot.
                Post-processing can both make up for effects you couldn’t create during the shoot and enhance the
                beautiful feature you did capture. It’s essentially the icing on the cake.
                <br>
                Even the most talented photographers apply edits to their shots.
                <br>
                The meaning of photo editing is the act of altering an image, simply put. But that’s oversimplifying a
                subject which is quite complex. For example, some photo editing techniques are done manually, while
                others are conducted through automated software.
                <br>
                Some photo editing is even done offline, on actual photographs, posters or other
                printed collateral. Before the modern technology Art directors, graphic designers, and publishers
                labored long hours over images, attempting to perfect skin,

                materials, and other issues which, today, would be easily whisked away with the click of a mouse.
                Tools like paint, erasers, airbrushes, and other art supplies were necessary in any studio — as was a
                steady hand and a keen eye for color and shadow.
                <br>
                A couple of features of image editing are: selection, layers, image size alteration, cropping,
                histogram, noise reduction, selective colour change, image orientation, perspective control and
                distortion,
                lens correction, enhancing image, sharpening and softening images, slicing of images, special effects,
                exposure control
                and the list never stops.
                <br>
                Creators use photo editing according to their own taste; whether it be editing a video thumbnail or
                enhancing quality of
                captured raw images, from creating memories to making them memorable.
                <br>
                Editing photos marked the era of the creators. Like black and white? Or you want to control that
                over-exposed sky? Is the
                low light shot stinging you? Or you just want to make shadows less obtrusive?
                <br>

        <hr>
        <div class="about">
            <p class="first">
                Music production is the process of developing, creating and refining recorded music for public
                presentation. Music production can refer to the entire life cycle of a piece of music—from songwriting
                and composition to recording and sound design to mixing and mastering.
                <br>
                Despite the broad definition, every workflow in modern music production has one thing in common—digital
                tools.
                <br>
                Some of us are old enough to remember a different time in music production. Not only did we make and mix
                music differently, we distributed it in a way that kids today would see as completely alien. That's
                because today you can record, mix, and share music all before breakfast – all with the use of leading
                technology. Music production is more accessible than ever before. For the lowest price
                in history any musician can set up a home studio and get started producing music.Gone is the necessity

                label backing, as is the standard 4- or 5-piece band. We're on the cusp of a technology surge in
                the music industry that will decide the future of music creation, as well as how we share, consume, and
                profit from music.
                <br>
                There is an absolute multitude of gadgetry available to the modern musician, from DAWs to synthesizers,
                to social media and music streaming services. The availability of these technologies finally takes music
                out of the hands of record labels and into the hands of the musicians, with the new challenge of how to
                profit.
                <br>
                Current technology makes it easier for a musician to produce their own music, but used correctly is can
                also help a musician promote themselves and earn money. There are even some benefits, like that a
                musician no longer has to compete with other artists for shelf space in a store, nor do they worry about
                distributors or producers. Physical record sales are becoming less viable as the years go on, but a
                musician can earn money by streaming music, earning royalties and signing licenses, or even by teaching
                music through online tutorial.
                <br>
                People can openly express themselves.
